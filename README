To run the distMeasurement.py, enter the command 'sudo python3 distMeasurement.py' in its directory. The file 'targets.txt' must be populated with website names, 1 per line. The output file does not need to exist, the script will overwrite or create it.

How to match ICMP responses?
I see if the response is from the website I am currently waiting on a response for, as I do them one at a time. I also check if at least one header type matches the header type I set (3) and portno are the same.

Reasons for not getting a response?
The websites probed may have a firewall that blocks incoming messages like mine that follow no real protocol. In addition, their servers may have a different configuration where the port I send the UDP packet to is in use for something else, and throws an error instead of responding.

***NOTE***
The data in the PDF are results from me running distMeasurement.py as described above on my personal laptop on CaseWireless. I ran the script on the aws server and received different data (Contacted walmart.com when my laptop did not).

The graph and data for the graph of RTT vs Hop count is in the proj2data-Sheet1.pdf. The general trend is for RTT to increase exponentially with hop count, although the website voc.com.cn was an exception with a low hop count but the highest RTT by far (possible due to geographical distance). For the rest of the data, RTT was fairly low until reaching around 23-24 ms, where it started increasing exponentially.
